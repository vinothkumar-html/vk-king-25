      A paragraph is a distinct unit of writing, typically consisting of several
      sentences, that focuses on a single idea or topic. It helps to organize
      and structure written work, making it easier for readers to follow the
      author's train of thought. A paragraph is often indicated by an indent at
      the beginning of the first sentence.
